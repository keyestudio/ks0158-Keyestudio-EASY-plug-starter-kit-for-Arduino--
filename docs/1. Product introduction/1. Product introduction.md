About its pins and main components:

![](media/image-20251127121608344.png)

The processor of this EASY plug Control board V2.0 is ATmega328. Furthermore, its IO ports are extended out through crystal connectors. And it is equipped with power jack which enables you to attach the board with external sensor/modules via a single cable saving you from damaging components for wiring in an improper way.

This board boasts 5 digital pins（from D5-D9 of which D5,D6 and D9 are designed for PWM）a dual digital pin（D3 and D4），4 analog input pins（from A0-A3），a joystick module pin （D2 ,A6 and A7），1SPI communication pin, a serial communication interface,  and a I2C communication interface. A cable with RJ11 crystal connector is needed to link the board with modules when conducting experiments.
